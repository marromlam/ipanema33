        IPANEMA: Hyperthread Curve-Fitting Module for Python
        
        Ipanema provides a high-level interface to non-linear for Python.
        It supports most of the optimization methods from scipy.optimize jointly with
        others like emcc, ampgo and the so-calle Minuit.
        
        Main functionalities:
        
          * Despite the comon use of plain float as fitting variables, Ipanema relies on
            the Parameter class.  A Parameter has a value that can be varied in the fit,
            fixed, have upper and/or lower bounds. It can even have a value that is
            constrained by an algebraic expression of other Parameter values.
        
          * Multiple fitting algorithms working out-of-the-box without any change in
            the cost function to minimize.
        
          * Hyperthreading is avaliable and models can be compilead against different
            backends. One can use python for fits as usual, but if the amount of data
            is large, then better rewrite your code in cuda or opencl, and Ipanema can
            take care of that cost function. That's simple.
        
          * Improved estimation of confidence intervals. While
            scipy.optimize.leastsq() will automatically calculate uncertainties
            and correlations from the covariance matrix, lmfit also has functions
            to explicitly explore parameter space to determine confidence levels
            even for the most difficult cases.
        
          * Improved curve-fitting with the Model class. This extends the
            capabilities of scipy.optimize.curve_fit(), allowing you to turn a
            function that models your data into a Python class that helps you
            parametrize and fit data with that model.
        
          * Many built-in models for common lineshapes are included and ready
            to use.
