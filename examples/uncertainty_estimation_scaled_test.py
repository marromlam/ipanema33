DESCRIPTION = """
    This example is taken from "Tratamiento de datos f√≠sicos - Varela et al."
    where the estimators are
        a = 0.071 +/- 0.019
        b = 0.02620 +/- 0.00034
   computed as a linear regresion vai least squares fit.
   As minuit does not scale the error matrix, uncertanties coming from it are
   wrongly evaluated. Be aware of that.
